		<h4>Philosophy</h4>
		<p>
			I love to create and to build. Whether it's a web or mobile property, or a physical product - I just love to create and build.
			My design philosophy orbits around a star called "Thoughtfulness." Empathize with the user, no matter what the product is. I feel if being thoughtful is at the top of the list when going into a project - the outcome will be greater.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a great set of skills for when it comes to web and mobile design. UX being the focus, my UI elements have a tendency to come out simple and elegant.
		</p>
		<h3>Process</h3>
		<p>
			It all starts with a solid wire-framing phase   where I like to sketch on paper or a white board to get a full scope laid out, and knock-out any hitches that might come up early-on.
		</p><p>
			Next is usability. I come up with some low-res mock-ups of the design in digital format, then use a prototyping suite such as Invision to make sure the UX of the product is great. This will involve a design review, preferably with other designers, and hopefully some others with an outside perspective.
		</p><p>
			Once the UX is in order, it's party time: hi-res designs of the final product are made. This is a very important part of the design where the aesthetic is carefully determined in a way to maintain the integrity of the experience. This phase embeds character into the product with thoughtful iconography and easily-graspable interaction.

		<h4>Experience</h4>
		<p>
			I've been working at startups most my life, dating back to 2000. The idea of smaller teams and the high level of focus that's usually involved is something that gets me going. I've also been a part of some larger companies through the years and can also strive in a bigger, more elaborate setting.
		</p>
		<p>
			A notable part of my experience was being an early employee at Qik. It was a lot of unique experiences summed up into one place. Tough financial times, short eras of stagnation but eventually, times of growth and success! The company was acquired by Skype in 2011. It felt amazing to be a core part of a successful team like this.
		</p>
		<p>
			More recently, I was the first employee of a startup called WiFast. For 2.5 years I was at the helm of everything related to design - All of the UX, UI, branding and front-end code. This was also an amazing experience since it was so early on in the life of the company. WiFast still grows today!

			In my free time, I’m usually either working out, building something, or hanging with friends.
		</p>
		<p>
			I exercise pretty much daily. I’m convinced that this is the key to a healthy, long life. The activites include crossfit, cycling, and hiking.
		</p>
		<p>
			I get antsy when I haven’t built something in a while. So I’ll always have various projects going on, mostly wood. Recent projects include an arcade machine, a bunch of lamps, and a desk made out of a shuffleboard surface.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’ve pretty much hit the jackpot with my friends. It’s wild, they’re all talented or creative to some extent and all of them are doing stuff, all the time. It’s really inspiring to be around. I consider myself fortunate.
		</p>
		<p>
			Right up there with exercise, I feel like staying creative and curious is also beneficial to your health. Keeping the mind constantly exercized is the only way I know how to be. How things work, how they can be fixed, optimized and improved is always something that'll always be a part of me. I can't imagine a world without curiosity.
