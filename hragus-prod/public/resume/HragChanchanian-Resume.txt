== ROLE ==
Design Lead, Web Developer @ Zenreach (formerly WiFast)  |  April 2012  July 2014

As employee #1 my role was to own everything design, in addition to
bringing them to fruition. This included all UX, UI, aesthetics, identity and
further, the front-end code. All design work started on a pad or a
whiteboard, into wireframes, low-res mockups, then final hi-res versions
ready for user testing. This method allowed for great, usable final
products.


== ROLE ==
Director of Technical Operations, Designer, Web Developer @ Qik - Skype - Microsoft  |  June 2008  April 2012

I joined Qik early on as a developer. But, like in most startups, roles
shifted around. I played an important part in the company over the years
and was named a key employee in the acquisition by Skype in 2011. I
designed, and branded the app which would go to provide the first real
revenue for the company. In parallel, I had the opportunity to help out in
our data center. Ultimately, I was given the responsibility of building up
and looking after the companys physical server infrastructure - a task I
had never encountered. I gladly, single-handedly built-up and maintained
the server foundation that Qiks technology stood on. This eventually
involved strict SLAs with mobile carriers which meant being on-call 24/7.
In addition, I spent a lot of time constantly optimizing and improving the
service wherever I could. The end result was hundreds of servers
operating globally on a plan designed and executed by me.


== ROLE ==
Owner @ Heavybig  |  January 2009  Present

This is basically a vessel for other creative projects Ive done over the
years. Its gone from freelance design to today, a name I use for the
physical products/projects Ive worked on. Its the stuff I do for fun!


== PHILOSOPHY ==
My philosophy orbits around a star
called thoughtfulness." Empathize
with the user, no matter what the
product is. I feel if being thoughtful is
at the top of the list when entering a
project - the outcome will be great.
