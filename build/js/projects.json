During my efforts of conceptualizing, wireframing, and designing - I ran into a hurdle that would stop me in my tracks: insurance. While working on the product, I decided to survey the public (using Google as the means of outreach through ads) to ensure that I was on the right track - One of my questions was “What might prevent you from using a service like this?” and an unignorable ratio of survey participants responded with concerns about their belongings breaking or not being returned. This lead me into exploring ways to protect the users, and the company. At the time, there was no such insurance flexible enough to insure items in the manner that I needed. I spent some time trying to solve this, but eventually became overwhelmed with my actual job and have since shelved the project.",

The cover itself is a 24oz Mason jar, which unscrews allowing access to the light bulb - it’s also sand-blasted in order to soften the light. If you flip the lamp upside down, there is a single circular rubber stopper. This fits snug into the grooves and when pulled off reveals the 4 screws which hold the lamp together.",
